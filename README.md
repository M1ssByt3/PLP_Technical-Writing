# How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
  For Tech Experts (Developers, Engineers, IT Professionals):

    Provide in-depth details, such as code snippets, system architecture, API documentation, and debugging steps.
    Assume familiarity with key concepts and avoid oversimplifying.
    Focus on efficiency, best practices, and optimization.

For Non-Technical Users (End-Users, Managers, Clients):

    Use simple language, avoiding excessive technical jargon.
    Explain concepts in layman’s terms with real-world analogies.
    Provide step-by-step instructions, visuals, or flowcharts for better comprehension.
    Focus on how the software benefits them rather than its internal workings
